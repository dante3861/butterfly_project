### This is for MRes project of butterfly (database: NHM), Imperial College London.<br>Author: Han Zhitong

contour.py describes a function using opencv to extract contour as well as wing veins (depends on the threshold of extraction).
<br><br>infro.r includes all function I used in the thesis, including data wragling, map plotting, morphology process, PCA, results plot, regression etc..there are also some functions I coded but weren't mentioned in the report.
<br><br>method.r is created when I trying to choose the type of Fourier transform because there are different variants. I tested them and picked the best performed one, which is elliptical Fourier transform.
